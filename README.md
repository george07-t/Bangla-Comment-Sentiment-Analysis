## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Bangla text data. The goal is to classify comments into positive and negative categories using advanced machine learning techniques. The model leverages various NLP preprocessing steps and is trained using a deep learning model with custom layers tailored for Bangla language processing.

### üéØ Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Custom Bangla text processing pipeline including tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes deep learning architecture, possibly involving LSTM or Transformer-based models, to handle Bangla text efficiently.
- **Performance Metrics**: High accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC, demonstrating robust classification performance.

## üìä Results

### Training and Validation Loss

The training loss decreases significantly while the validation loss remains relatively stable, indicating a good learning process but potential overfitting in later epochs.

### ROC Curve

## üîç **Analysis**

### Class Distribution

- **Positive Comments**: 1,267
- **Negative Comments**: 7,214

The dataset is significantly imbalanced, which could affect model performance. Consider using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting to address this.

### Recommendations

- **Overfitting**: The model shows signs of overfitting; consider using regularization techniques or early stopping.
- **Class Imbalance**: Address the imbalance in the dataset to improve the model's precision for the minority class.

## üìö Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of Bangla text comments labeled as either positive or negative. The dataset is imbalanced, with a higher number of negative comments compared to positive ones.

### Dataset Details

- **Positive Comments**: 1,267
- **Negative Comments**: 7,214

The comments are collected from various sources, primarily focusing on social media and user-generated content platforms where Bangla is predominantly used.

### How to Find the Data

The dataset can be found on Kaggle and is available for download at the following link:

[Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/your-dataset-link)

Once you download the dataset from Kaggle, place the relevant files in the `data/` directory of this repository. The dataset should include:

- `train.csv`: The training dataset with comments and their corresponding sentiment labels.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset used for evaluating model performance.

If you wish to use your own dataset, place it in the `data/` directory and ensure it follows the same structure as the provided files:

- **Columns**: `comment`, `label`
  - `comment`: The text of the comment in Bangla.
  - `label`: The sentiment label, where `1` represents positive sentiment and `0` represents negative sentiment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bangla-sentiment-analysis.git

   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   jupyter notebook notebooks/bangla-sentiment-analysis.ipynb
   
## üîç **Analysis**

### Class Distribution

- **Positive Comments**: 5,731
- **Negative Comments**: 86,855

The dataset is significantly imbalanced, which could affect model performance. Consider using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting to address this.

### Recommendations
- **Class Imbalance**: Address the imbalance in the dataset to improve the model's precision for the minority class.
